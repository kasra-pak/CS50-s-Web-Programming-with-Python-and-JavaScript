# CS50-s-Web-Programming-with-Python-and-JavaScript
I will go along with this course from university of harvard, and will push the projects here.

Actually i saw this course online and started watching it on youtube, after a while i found it usefull so i searched more to find the project descriptions, mentioned in
videos so i found the below link which is a complete reference for files, projects, notes and other things used in this course;
https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2018/

For now it's been a while that i'm working on projects defined in different sessions to gain more understanding around course subjects.
