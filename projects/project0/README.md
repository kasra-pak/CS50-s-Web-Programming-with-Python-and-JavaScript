https://docs.cs50.net/ocw/web/projects/0/project0.html

The website idea was around cycling, as i'm interested in cycling i decided to make a frontend to give some info about different 
popular types of cycling and also have a hand on html and css. The webpage has a main html file which shows you a grid of different types of cycling,
which you can clikc each one for more description in that field.
