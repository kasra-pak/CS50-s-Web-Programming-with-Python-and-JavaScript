            An offshoot of mountain biking, downhill mountain biking might appear similar to cross country full suspension bikes.
            This is certainly not the case. Downhill mountain biking is a sport that requires more agility and skill than aerobic
            strength because this sport is all about the rider, the trail, and gravity. Downhill bikes are built to withstand the
            extreme forces they must undergo as a rider makes his way down a steep “trail”, while keeping the rider protected from
            the intense shock at the same time.

            Downhill contests are filled to the brim with adrenaline rush and are probably the most exciting event on two wheels to
            watch. While Singapore is not yet an ideal location for downhill mountain biking, expect this sport to grow, and trails
            be made available, as the country has played host to the Red Bull Dark Knights downhill event for a few years already.
