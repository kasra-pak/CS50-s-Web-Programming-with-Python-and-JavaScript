        <p>Riding on the smooth tarmac that crisscross our island may seem like a monotonous task that any bike can achieve,
            but road cycling is all about speed. Getting from point A to point B as fast as one’s fitness allows is of key
            importance in this sport whether one is riding a timed sportive (long, point – to – point rides), a criterium
            (short races in a small circuit), or a single or multi day stage race. To accomplish this, a bike that is light,
            stiff, and geometrically matches your preferences is the most important tool for a road cyclist.
        </p>
        <p>
            A road bike needs to be light so that its weight does not hold you back during long, steep climbs. It must be stiff
            enough such that each pedal stroke transfers completely to the wheels (speed!) instead of the frame, in turn creating flex.
            The geometry must also provide handling that suits your personal preference. Do you want a bike that is sensitive and reacts
            to the slightest of inputs, or do you prefer a stable one that can easily track a straight line?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are roadbikes that fall under these 2 extremes, and many others in between. It will be best to test ride different types
            of bikes that fit you, this will help you start off with a bike that handles just the way you like it! As you gain more miles,
            your preferences may change due to experience, and the events you may eventually participate in  the future.
