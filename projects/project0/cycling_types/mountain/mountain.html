            Mountain biking is considered somewhat of an adventure sport where cyclists ride their bicycles over rough terrain.
            There are many sub-disciplines of mountain biking. Cross country is the choice for most beginners starting out in
            mountain biking and is another very popular cycle sport in Singapore.Mountain biking is a sport that requires strength,
            agility, and good bike handling skills. Many successful professional road cyclists such as Cadel Evans and Ryder Hesjedal
            honed their skills in mountain biking during their early years in the sport.

            All bicycles in the mountain bike category come with a front fork suspension. In cross country biking, you can choose to
            go with either a hardtail which is a mountain bike with no rear suspension or a full suspension bicycle which is a bicycle
            that comes with a rear suspension for extra comfort and cushioning for steep drops and very rugged terrain.

            Whichever bike you choose will provide you tons of fun. Singapore may be a small island, but it offers many mountain bike
            trails that are just around a 30-60 minute ride from wherever you live.

            The Bukit Timah Trail which is located in the west is the most popular mountain bike trail in Singapore. The Kent Ridge Trail
            is located in the central part of Singapore. Over in the east, there is the Tampines Bike Trail (scheduled to close by June 2014),
            and the Ketam Trail located in Pulau Ubin island which is certainly worth the boat ride to check out as the Ketam Trail was designed
            and built to international standards. Remember to begin with a less technical trail if you are totally new to mountain bike.
            The former Singapore Rail Corridor (also known as the Green Corridor) is now a trail that is perfect for beginners to start with.
