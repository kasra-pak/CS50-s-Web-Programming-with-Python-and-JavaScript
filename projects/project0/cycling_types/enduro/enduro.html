            Enduro in its most basic definition is a type of mountain bike racing where the downhills are timed, and the uphills are mandatory
            but not timed. Riders are timed in stages that are primarily downhill, with neutral "transfer" stages in between. The transfer
            stages usually must be completed within a time-limit, but are not part of the accumulated time. Enduros typically take place over
            one or two days, however, week-long competitions also exist such as the Trans Provence (France), the Andes Pacifico (Chile),
            and the Pisgah Stage Race (United States). A typical one-day enduro consists of 3 to 5 timed stages which take place on technically
            demanding, generally descending terrain, and often with sections of singletrack.

            Enduro differs from cross-country (XC) racing which usually has more emphasis on cardiovascular fitness and less emphasis on technical
            ability, and pure downhill racing, which may contain little to no cross-country or climbing. Enduro's 'All Mountain' discipline therefore
            favours riders with a breadth of skill, on multi-discipline cycles. Lightweight XC bikes may lack sufficient suspension for fast downhill
            control, while full downhill bikes may not allow a rider to climb the uphill sections efficiently. In some countries, the term enduro is
            considered a contraction of "endurance".

            The origins of enduro mountain bike racing come from some inspiration from both car rally such as the World Rally Championship and motorbike
            enduro racing. Mountain bike enduro is essentially the competitive side of the mountain biking format often referred to today as "All-Mountain".
            It arose from everyday mountain bike riding, which originally entailed riding to the top of the mountain and then racing to the bottom.
            The first reported enduro race, using the modern format, was held in August 2003 in Val Dâ€™Allos. Earlier enduro-style local races were run in
            Italy, New Zealand, and the UK during the 80's and 90's. A precursor to the modern enduro format was the rallye format based on time stages and
            unlimited liaisons. However these races, located in France, tended to be more cross-country rather than downhill orientated.
