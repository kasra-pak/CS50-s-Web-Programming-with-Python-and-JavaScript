            Finally, there is Bicycle Moto-Cross, more popularly known as BMX. BMX bikes are the simplest of the disciplines featured here
            because they do not require multiple gears or advanced hydraulic disc brakes. BMX bikes are built to be quick, light, and agile
            to enable racers to maneuver around a twisty and tight track as fast as possible. Hence, they are also the most popular bikes
            amongst youth.

            Quite a few of the biggest cyclists started out riding BMX for fun when they were young. However, there is a serious side to BMX
            as a sport - BMX has been included as an Olympic sport since 2008. For those who are keen to try out this sport, there are BMX
            lessons available and a BMX track at the Tampines Bike Park that was built for the Youth Olympic Games in 2010.
