            Ever wondered how road bikes would fare in muddy conditions? Cyclocross is road cyclingâ€™s closest cousin. It is a sport
            where riding a bike hard around a short circuit is the norm, with obstacles thrown in to add to the excitement. It is
            arguably one of the most exciting spectator sport on two wheels. Cyclocross has grown to be so popular that there are
            petitions for its inclusion as an Olympic sport.

            Cyclocross races are very short, usually less than an hour, but require enormous physical effort from its participants.
            This, coupled with the need for racers to run up stairs, ramps, and obstacles with their bikes, make it a very demanding
            sport that provides tons of excitement from start to finish. While the sport is most popular in Belgium, where top cyclocrossers
            hail from, its popularity has begun slowly spreading across the Americas.

            Cyclocross bikes look very much like road bikes, but are very different. These bikes are designed to handle well under slow speeds,
            brake well under extreme conditions in muddy terrain, and are light enough to carry when a rider needs to clear a tall obstacle.
            Cyclocross gearing also allows its riders to ride up short but very steep and slippery inclines as the best races are usually done
            under wet conditions.
